# CustomParametersExample
Youtube: 
Code used to illustrate the use of custom parameters in Portal.
There is a basic game built into this using the vehicle superiority mode as the base.
If you are looking for the custom parameters examples, here I have shown an example of using it to set basic settings. You dont really need to do it this way and the video outlines more but if you are curious then this is an example of how.
I've also used it to set various settings for the icons - this don't get passed as event payloads so are a good example of where you might want to use them.
As there are now a lot of global variables, you 'could' use those. It isnt best practice to do that but as we arent necessarily focussing on best practice for programming in Portal, often if it works for you then it works.
